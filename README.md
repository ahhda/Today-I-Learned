# Today-I-Learned
A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day.

1. **[January 23, 2017](#)** [Creating an Alexa skill, AWS Lambda, Localization in Robotics](#).  
Today I learned how to create custom Alexa skills using AWS Lambda for the Amazon Echo. I developed a skill which sends you a random design quote from the website: [quotesondesign](http://quotesondesign.com). Wrote a Lambda function using NodeJS which calls their API. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt9WdE5kR6g) explains a lot of stuff quickly to get you started. Also started the [Artificial Intelligence for Robotics](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373) course on Udacity. Learned about Localization, inaccurate vs exact robot motion, robot sense and movement. You can find more info in the [Lesson 1 Notes](https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/48739381/Lesson1Notes.pdf). Loving the course!

2. **[January 24, 2017](#)** [Chrome extension, SSH Tunelling, 2D Localization](#).  
Created a small chrome extension which waits for changes on a webpage and extracts a url once a particular div has changed and sends a push notification on my phone. Used [extensionizr](http://extensionizr.com/) to quickly create a boilerplate and get started on the extension. Used [onesignal](https://onesignal.com/) for push notifications. Created my own VPN using AWS EC2 and SSH Tunelling. Very useful if your college internet has a lot of restrictions. Follow [this](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/how-to-make-your-own-free-vpn-using-amazon-web-services/) article to quickly get started. Also learned 2D Localization.
